# Multi-view Camera-Depth Calibration

The project is based on [Konstantin's](https://github.com/KonstantinPakulev/CalibrationProject) project.  

A new file `azure_rgb_to_depth_extrinsics_calibration.ipynb` is based  
on Konstantin's `azure_s10_extrinsics_calibration.ipynb` file in order  
to provide __Azure color-to-depth extrinsics calibration__  
instead of Samsung S10 smartphone color camera to Azure depth camera extr. calib.  

Only `utils/io_utils.py` have been modified in addition to a new file. Other files are original.
